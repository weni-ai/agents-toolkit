    An immutable context container for preprocessor execution.
    
    The PreProcessorContext class provides a thread-safe, immutable container for passing data
    to preprocessor during execution. It contains three separate namespaces:

        params (Mapping): Immutable mapping for preprocessor-specific parameters

        credentials (Mapping): Immutable mapping for credentials data
