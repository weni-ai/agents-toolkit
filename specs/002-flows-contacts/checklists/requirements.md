# Specification Quality Checklist: Flows Contacts Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass (iteration 1): All checklist items satisfied. The spec references the Flows contacts endpoint path and existing package names only in the Input traceability field and Dependencies/Assumptions sections as external or prior-art context; functional requirements describe capabilities without prescribing implementation technology.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- Clarification session 2026-06-11: 5 decisions integrated (update payload scope, update-only semantics, 9th-digit retry, urns validation reject, hybrid update API).
